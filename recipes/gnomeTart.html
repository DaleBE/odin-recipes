    <p>
        Here's a delightful dish that will win you favour with the Gnomes that live near you. Gnomes are amusing little creatures
        and can be quite helpful to humans if they are on your side. They are also good fun for cats to play with and it would suit you
        well to summon some around for us cats. Though these can be made at anytime, I would recommend making these on a clear autumn evening as the sun is setting.

        <li>fresh pastry dough</li>

    <ol>

        <li>Take the berries and put a small layer of them into the bottoms of each of the tart shells.</li>

        <li>Bake these all until they look just lovely and cooked</li>
        <li>Take the just baked tarts outside quickly and place them at the base of a tree or rocky outcrop, preferably near a woodland.</li>
