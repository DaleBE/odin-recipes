    <h1>Magical Moon Milk</h1>

    <p>
        First, and most importantly, you humans <strong>MUST</strong> learn to make this delightful little dish. Cats, being naturally magical creatures,
        require a little recharge of sorts once and a while and this little number will certainly do the trick! This dish also wins you favour
        from night sprites and moon faeries. Make sure and find the freshest milk you can and always make it on the night of a full moon.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>a dish of fresh milk, cow preferably</li>
        <li>a dash of Nepeta cataria (Catmint)</li>
        <li>a white candle</li>
        <li>a silver ribbon</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Methodology</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>First of all, you pick a night when the moon is full and the sky is clear. You will also need to ask a cat to help you.</li>
        <li>Next you fill a nice looking shallow dish with the fresh milk that you have acquired and sprinkle a dash of Catmint in it.</li>
        <li>Then you will tie the silver ribbion around the white candle in a sort of bow and you will take the candle and dish of milk outside.</li>
        <li>
            Explain to the cat that you are helping it make some Moon Milk and request that it joins you outside. Soon after the cat will help you 
            find the appropriate spot to place the dish. 
        </li>
        <li>Place the candle in a safe place nearby and light it and walk away.</li> 
        <li>That's it really, you must now let the cat do what it needs to do in peace.</li>
    </ol>
