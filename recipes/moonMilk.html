    <h1>Magical Moon Milk</h1>

    <p>
        First, and most importantly, you humans must learn to make this delightful little dish. Cats, being naturally magical creatures,
        require a little recharge of sorts once and a while and this little number will certainly do the trick! This dish also wins you favour
        from night sprites and moon faeries. Make sure and find the freshest milk you can and always make it on the night of a full moon.
