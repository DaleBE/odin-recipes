        <h1>Hedgerow Troll Stew</h1>

        <p>
            Trolls are quite bothersome creatures! They bother cats to no end and have been known to eat a human servant or two.
            You really should avoid them at all costs, but if you should notice that they are liotering about nearby you should lure them away
            by making this dish. Take a walk to the nearest hedgerow or roadside to find the ingredients that you need.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>garbage, plain and simple .. cans, wrappers, rotten food</li>
            <li>some smelly little dead creatures</li>
            <li>mud</li>
            <li>branches</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                This one is quite simple. You just take all your ingredients and mix them together in a pot that you don't need.
                Trolls are <strong>DISGUSTING</strong> creatures and will eat anything, even the pot! No need to cook this dish, they are not worth the bother.
            </li>
            <li>
                Then, in a hurry you run-by where they are loitering around and lead them as far away as you can. Make sure you have just bathed before hand
                and there will be minor risk for your part.
            </li>
            <li>
                When you have gone as far as you think is necessary, go a little futher. Really, they are quite <em>repulsive</em> and no cat
                would want them anywhere near!
            </li>
            <li>Toss the pot as far as you can and run back home to bathe yourself again. That should keep them away.</li>
        </ol>
