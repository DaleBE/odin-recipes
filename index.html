            Welcome and greetings, as I lay here on one of my <strong>many</strong> <em>sof-A's</em> I contemplate the reason that 
            I, <strong>Lord Thomas WhiteBoot of London</strong>, have created this <em>wonderful and priceless</em> resource. It is an aid to all you humans in servitude to 
            us, <strong>felines</strong>,  the <em>superior</em> species; and make no mistake you are <strong>ALL</strong> in servitude to us. 
            Being the <em>overly generous</em> and somewhat <em>caring</em> cat that I
            am I felt an overall need to share my <strong>great and wonderous</strong> magical knowledge with you all to
            keep you safe until you are no longer needed. 
        </p>
        <p>
            You see, I pity you humans and your <strong>incredibly dull</strong> senses when it comes to percieving the <em>infinitely
            magical and awe-inspiring</em> world that we both find ourselves in. Frankly, I believe that you should all strive to be 
            more like us cats. Though you could never <strong>BE</strong> like us, I still think it would benifit us cats most if 
            you were to <strong>try</strong>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Below are a few of my <em>many</em> useful recipes that I'm sure you will find very <em>practical and powerful</em>
            to aid you in the making of running errads for us safer.
        </p>
        <p>
            You are <em>very</em> welcome!
        </p>
